The list of pull requests associated with this feature is:

- [PR #223](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es21-g21/pull/223)


### Frontend
We could not complete update, nor show, because we have a backend related problem where the combinations of the items
come with their attributes null, even though all is correctly saved in the database.

#### New/Updated Views

- [EditQuestionSubmissionDialog](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es21-g21/blob/develop/frontend/src/views/teacher/questions/EditQuestionDialog.vue)
- [EditQuestionDialog](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es21-g21/blob/develop/frontend/src/views/questionsubmission/EditQuestionSubmissionDialog.vue)

In our branch we have another file for show, even though we can't know if it works because of the problems referred above:

- [ShowQuestion.vue](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es21-g21/blob/pci/frontend/src/views/teacher/questions/ShowQuestion.vue)


#### New/Updated Models

- [ItemCombinationAnswerDetails](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es21-g21/blob/develop/frontend/src/models/management/questions/ItemCombinationAnswerDetails.ts)
- [ItemCombinationQuestionDetails](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es21-g21/blob/develop/frontend/src/models/management/questions/ItemCombinationQuestionDetails.ts)

- [ItemCombinationStatementQuestionDetails](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es21-g21/blob/develop/frontend/src/models/statement/questions/ItemCombinationStatementQuestionDetails.ts)


### End-to-end tests

We tried to do the tests, but something wasn't working correctly, so we left them in our branch:
   
- [Tests file](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es21-g21/blob/pci/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/teacher/manageItemCombinationQuestionsExecution.js)


#### Commands defined

- [ItemCombinationCreate](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es21-g21/blob/develop/frontend/src/components/item-combination/ItemCombinationCreate.vue)

In our branch we have another file for show, even though we can't know if it works because of the problems referred above:

- [ItemCombinationView](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es21-g21/blob/pci/frontend/src/components/item-combination/ItemCombinationView.vue)

#### Screenshot of test results overview

We could not complete the test for create, making it impossible to do the other tests.
